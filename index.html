 </Font></h1>
<br>
<h2><Font face="Consolas"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>What is Dark Web and what will you find there...?</strong></span></font> </h2>

<p style="width: 1300px; height: 190px;" class="auto-style2"> 
<img alt="" src="file:///C:/Users/Dell/Desktop/dark_web.png" width="300px" height="200px" align="right"><Font size="3"><span class="auto-style4">THE DARK WEB is a collection of thousands of websites. They use anonymity tools like Tor 
</span> <br class="auto-style4"> <span class="auto-style4">and I2P to hide their IP address.
     While it's most famously been used for black market drug sales </span> 
<br class="auto-style4"> <span class="auto-style4">and even child pornography, the Dark Web also enables anonymous
      whistleblowing and protects </span> <br class="auto-style4"> 
<span class="auto-style4">users from surveillance and censorship.</span><br>
<br><Font face="Consolas">In addition to information, Dark Web markets also deal in other nefarious things like criminal services, <br >espionage, 
    illegal collectibles or animals, human trafficking, credit card numbers, drugs, guns,<br> counterfeit money, stolen goods, 
    password lists, cybercrime software, cracked credentials,<br> and other shady business.

<h2 align="center" class="auto-style1">How can u enter the Dark Web...?</h2>
<p align="center"><span class="auto-style4">Notably, addresses and websites over the Dark Web cannot be accessed using any normal web browsers like Google Chrome.</span><br class="auto-style4">
     <span class="auto-style4">TOR is the most commonly used browser to access Dark Web. You should close all your web browser windows, and apps
      connected to the Internet.</span></p>
<h2 align="center" class="auto-style4">About TOR browser</h2>
<p align="center"><span class="auto-style4">Using Tor isn't illegal. The Tor browser gives users anonymous access to a free internet. As is the case with everything,</span><br class="auto-style4"> 
<span class="auto-style4">this access 
    can be used in both good and bad ways. After all, Tor also allows people to visit criminal websites and marketplaces on the dark web. 
</span> <br class="auto-style4">
     <span class="auto-style4">The name Tor is an acronym for 'The Onion Router,' which is a specialized browser that sends the user's data through several anonymous servers. 
</span> <br class="auto-style4"><span class="auto-style4">The TOR browser hides your IP thus the police cannot be able to track you or whoever is using the Dark Web</span></p>

<p align="center"><br class="auto-style4"><span class="auto-style4">It's actually very risky to enter the Dark Web as the hackers can easily send malwares to your computer or the device you're using to. 
</span> <br class="auto-style4">
    <span class="auto-style4">These malwares then go through your computers and sooner all your personal information from photos to personal datas can be tracked by them and your computer would just be controlled by them...</span><br class="auto-style4">
     <span class="auto-style4">But proffesionals who have experience doing these have exceptions.</span></p>
<br class="auto-style4">
<br class="auto-style4">
<br class="auto-style4">
<br class="auto-style4">
<h2 align="center" class="auto-style4"> WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THE DARK...</h2>
<p><span class="auto-style5">- You can commission a murder for bitcoins.</span><br class="auto-style4">
<br class="auto-style4">
<span class="auto-style4">The Dark Web do not use orginal money but they use currency called "bitcoins".</span><br class="auto-style4"> 
<span class="auto-style4">You pay  dollars, or rupees,etc. to get bitcoins. Hiring a commission through Dark Web might seem stupid as the police and cyber could track the people. But thats why they use bitcoins instead. Both the parties wont know who charged the commission and who accepted the commission.</span></p>
<br class="auto-style4">
<p><span class="auto-style5">- Illegal collectibles or animals</span><br class="auto-style4">
<br class="auto-style4">
<span class="auto-style4">Some examples of illegal wildlife trade are well known, such as the poaching of elephants for ivory or tigers for their skins and bones. However, many other plant and animal species are similarly overexploited, from marine turtles to timber trees.</span></p>
   <br class="auto-style4">
   <p><span class="auto-style4">- </span><span class="auto-style5">Credit card numbers.</span>
       <br class="auto-style4"><br class="auto-style4">
   <span class="auto-style4">Personal information from US citizens found on the Dark Webâ€”ranging from Social Security numbers, stolen credit card numbers, hacked PayPal accounts, and moreâ€”is worth just $8 on average, according to a new report from tech research firm Comparitech.</span></p>
		<br class="auto-style4"> <br class="auto-style4">
    <h3 class="auto-style5">There are more things that happens in the dark web but we do not have to go through there and all. Stay safe, avoid yourself from these webs.</h3>
